This folder contains optional helpers for interacting with Midnight.

## Contracts

### `BlueBuyCallback`

A buy callback that uses liquidity supplied on Morpho Blue.

The callback owns the Blue position.
During a Midnight buy, it withdraws the required loan tokens from Blue and approves Midnight to pull them.
The callback data must be the ABI-encoded Blue `MarketParams`.

The owner can grant or revoke permission to manage the callback's Blue position with `setAuthorization`.

Anyone authorized to act for the owner on Midnight can trigger this callback through an offer, so the owner should only authorize trusted addresses.

### `BlueBuyCallbackFactory`

Deploys one deterministic `BlueBuyCallback` for an owner using `CREATE2` with a zero salt.
The owner is included in the creation code, so different owners get different callback addresses.

The factory records callbacks in `callbackOf` and `isBlueCallback`.

### `EcrecoverAuthorizer`

Lets an address grant or revoke a Midnight authorization using an EIP-712 signature.
It tracks one nonce per authorizer and rejects expired, replayed, invalid, or unauthorized signatures.

The authorizer must first authorize this contract on Midnight.

### `Log`

An onchain mempool for Midnight.
Its fallback publishes calldata in a `Data` event.
Calldata is limited to 1,000,000 bytes.

## Libraries

### `TakeAmountsLib`

Converts target buyer or seller asset amounts into the number of units to take from an offer.
It accounts for the offer price, settlement fee, side, and Midnight's rounding behavior.

### `ConsumableUnitsLib`

Returns the number of units needed to fully consume an offer based on its remaining `maxUnits` or `maxAssets`.
